/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint 
 * stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses 
 * have security system connected and it will automatically contact the 
 * police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of 
 * money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can 
 * rob tonight without alerting the police.
 * 去掉背景题目大意是：给出一串无序整数序列A，要求找出子序列B，要求B不得去A中相邻的元素，是的B的和最大。
 * 如：A={3,1,1,8}最大子序列和为11，B={3,8}
 *
